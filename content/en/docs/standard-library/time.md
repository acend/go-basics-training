## Basics

Time is represented with the [time.Time](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time) struct.

The output in the examples below is generated by the [Go playground](https://go.dev/play/). The Go playground uses a static time to achieve optimal caching performance.

```go
package main

func main() {
    time := time.Now()
    fmt.Println(time)
}
<!--output-->
2009-11-10 23:00:00 +0000 UTC m=+0.000000001
```


## Parsing

To parse a string to `time.Time` we use [time.Parse](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Parse). Other programming languages often use "format strings" that look something like: `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`. Go does things differently and uses a reference time.
```
Jan 2 15:04:05 2006 MST
```

An easy way to remember this value is that it holds, when presented
in this order, the values (lined up with the elements above):
```
 1  2  3  4  5   6  -7
```

Every layout string is a representation of this time stamp. If you want to format a date differently, you must rewrite the above date.

Example:
```
Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006
```

```go
package main

func main() {
    t, err := time.Parse("Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006", "Thu Feb 25 11:06:39 PST 2021")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(t)
    fmt.Println(t.Weekday())
}
<!--output-->
2021-02-25 11:06:39 +0000 PST
Thursday
```


## Comparing dates

Dates can be compared with [time.Before](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time.Before) and [time.After](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time.After)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	year2000 := time.Date(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)
	year3000 := time.Date(3000, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)

	isYear3000AfterYear2000 := year3000.After(year2000) // True
	isYear2000AfterYear3000 := year2000.After(year3000) // False

	fmt.Printf("year3000.After(year2000) = %v\n", isYear3000AfterYear2000)
	fmt.Printf("year2000.After(year3000) = %v\n", isYear2000AfterYear3000)

}
<!--output-->
year3000.After(year2000) = true
year2000.After(year3000) = false
```


## Duration

A [time.Duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration) represents the time between two instants.

To get a duration we can subtract two dates:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func expensiveCall() {
    time.Sleep(10 * time.Second)
}

func main() {
	t0 := time.Now()
	expensiveCall()
	t1 := time.Now()
    duration := t1.Sub(t0)
	fmt.Printf("The call took %v to run.\n", duration)
}
<!--output-->
The call took 10s to run.
```

This chapter will give you an overview of the most important language features of Go.
Since it is hard to learn a lot of new language features at once, we deliberatly left out certain constructs which, based on our expirience, are not used very often and which are not required most of the time.

If you are intressted in more details when going over the topics or when you come across a syntax construct somewhere else which we did not cover you can always reach out to the official Go resources which cover every feature in great detail:

* The [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/list) is similar to the overview in this chapter but it covers more details. It goes over most of the language features by looking at small examples.
* [Go Language Specification](https://go.dev/ref/spec)

Learning a new language is hard. You will be bombarded by new information and concepts. Remember that the primary goal is to get to know which features are available and not to memorize every little detail. You will probably have to come back to these earlier exercises later in this course. 

Ask questions if something is unclear, use Google and make your own notes.

In this chapter, we're going to get an overview that covers the most important language features of Go. This is by no means a complete list, but with these features you will already be able to solve a lot of programming problems.

If you are new to Go, this will be a lot of information. But don' panic. You don't have to remember all of it. The primary goal is to have heard the most important features and to get a feel for the language with the exercises.
If you want to implement something later in the course, but don't remember the syntax, you can always go back and look it up, google for it, or use a cheatsheet like this one: https://devhints.io/go

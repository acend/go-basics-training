This chapter will give you an overview of the most important Go language features. We tried to deliberately leave out more advanced features. Based on our experience, the covered topics are sufficient to understand most Go programs.

The official documentation is an excellent resource. It provides more details than this training and is especially helpful if you encounter a syntax construct that we did not cover.

* The [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/list) is similar to the overview in this chapter but it covers more details. It goes over most of the language features by looking at small examples.
* [Go Language Specification](https://go.dev/ref/spec)
* [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) offers some best practices and tips for writing Go.

Learning a new language is hard. You will be bombarded by new information and concepts. Remember that the primary goal is to get to know which features are available and not to memorize every little detail. You will probably have to come back to these earlier exercises later in this training.

Ask questions if something is unclear, use Google and make your own notes.

## Basics

Time is represented with the [time.Time](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time) struct.

The output in the examples below is generated by the [Go playground](https://go.dev/play/). The Go playground uses a static time to achieve optimal caching performance.

{{<go-playground>}}
package main

func main() {
    time := time.Now()
    fmt.Println(time)
}
<!--output-->
2009-11-10 23:00:00 +0000 UTC m=+0.000000001
{{</go-playground>}}


## Parsing

To parse a string to `time.Time` we use [time.Parse](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Parse). Other programming languages often use "format strings" that look something like: `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`. Go does things differently and uses a reference time.
```
Jan 2 15:04:05 2006 MST
```

An easy way to remember this value is that it holds, when presented
in this order, the values (lined up with the elements above):
```
 1  2  3  4  5   6  -7
```

Every layout string is a representation of this time stamp. If you want to format a date differently, you must rewrite the above date.

Example:
```
Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006
```

{{<go-playground>}}
package main

func main() {
    t, err := time.Parse("Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006", "Thu Feb 25 11:06:39 PST 2021")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(t)
    fmt.Println(t.Weekday())
}
<!--output-->
2021-02-25 11:06:39 +0000 PST

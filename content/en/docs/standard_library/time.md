## Basics

Time is represented with the [time.Time](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time) struct.

The output in the examples below is generated by the [Go playground](https://go.dev/play/). The Go playground uses a static time to achieve optimal caching performance.

{{<go-playground>}}
package main

func main() {
    time := time.Now()
    fmt.Println(time)
}
<!--output-->
2009-11-10 23:00:00 +0000 UTC m=+0.000000001

## Parsing

To parse a string to `time.Time` we use [time.Parse](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Parse). Other programming languages often use "format strings" that look something like: `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`. Go does things differently and uses a reference time.
